add a --version option;

come up with a better name than "timer-wrapper";

possibly inspect the contents of the exceptions for more fine-grained use;

don't right-align the names of the exceptions;

more descriptive variable names;

more comments (well, *any* comments);

test the scenario in which the file is unreadable, and catch that exception;

handle malformed lines in the file;
